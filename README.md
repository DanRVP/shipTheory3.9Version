Must have cake php 3.9 installed

Must have a way of localhosting

To connect to your database, you should chnage, the database, username and password in config/app_local.php

Run 'bin/cake migrations migrate' to get the MySQL database

Routes are not defined, so to acces the index go to 'http://localhost/shipTheoryVersion3.9/results'

Disclaimer: the styling was much nicer in 4.2.

Apologies in advance for any bugs, this is my first time working with this framework :)
